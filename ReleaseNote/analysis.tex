To reconstruct all the simulated particles we start with the final state particles and go backwards through the reaction chain.

\section{Final state particles}
	The selected final state particle are protons, anti-proton, \piminus, \piplus, \kminus and \kplus mesons.
	For the reconstruction of these particles an ideal tracking was used. 
	To make the selection a bit more realistic only particles with more than 3 hits in any inner tracking detector (MVD, STT and GEM)
	are selected.
	The selection criterion is chosen because three hits are defining a circle.
	A fourth hit point is than a validation of the track hypothesis.\\
	The particle identification (PID) is also ideal. 
	The selection criterion is set to 'best'.\vspace{11pt} \\
	The reconstruction efficiency for the final state particle is shown in table \ref{tab:finalstate_recoeff} and figure \ref{fig:finalstate_recoeff}.
	All reconstruction efficiencies are calculated with the MC matched particles.

\section{Reconstruction of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$}
	\subsection*{Selection}
		For the reconstruction of \lam a proton and a \piminus meson are combined and for the reconstruction of \alam a \antiproton and a \piplus are combined.		 
		After combining the daughter particles a mass window cut is performed.
		Only those particles are chosen which have a mass within a window of $0.3$\massunit which means $1.116\pm 0.15$\massunit.
		
		
		A vertex constraint fit with the PndKinVtxFitter is performed on the selected particle.
		This means that the tracks of the daughter particles are fitted to a common vertex point.  
		The \chisq and \chisq-probability distribution of the vertex fit for \lam is shown in figure \ref{fig:lambda_chi2}.
		
		\begin{figure}
			\centering
				\includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth]{./plots/lambda0/lambda0_chi2.pdf}
				\includegraphics [width=0.50\textwidth]{./plots/lambda0/lambda0_prob.pdf}
			\caption{\propose The upper plot shows the  \chisq distribution and the lower plot shows the \chisq-probability distribution for the \lam vertex fit.}
			\label{fig:lambda_chi2}
		\end{figure}
		
		In the \chisq-probability distribution one can see an increasing number of events for probabilities going to one.
		These feature is not coming from vertex fitting, which was test with the poormantracks algorithm of Ralf Kliemt. 
		\vspace{11pt}\\
		The fit information coming from the vertex fit are used to perform a mass constraint fit with the kinematic fitter PndKinFitter.
		After using both fitter the selection criterion is set. 
		One select only those particles which have a probability greater than $1\%$ in both fitter.
		A scheme which shows how the events are selected can be found in figure \ref{fig:lambda_scheme}. 
		
		\begin{figure}
			\centering
				\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./plots/combineLambda0.pdf}
			\caption{propose Scheme for \lam reconstruction}
			\label{fig:lambda_scheme}
		\end{figure}
		
		If there is more than one candidate left after these cuts, the best fitted candidate is chosen.
		
		
	\subsection*{Results}
		In this paragraph the results for the \lam and \alam selection are presented.
		The mass distributions for different cuts are shown in figure \ref{fig:lambda0_massdiffcuts} and figure \ref{fig:antilambda0_massdiffcuts}.
	
		\begin{figure}
			\centering
				\includegraphics[width=1.1\textwidth]{./plots/lambda0/lambda0_m_diffcuts.pdf}
			\caption{\propose Mass distribution of \lam after the mass window cut (blue), after the vertex fit cut (red) and after all cuts (black).}

					line after the vertex cut and the black line describes the distribution after all cuts.}
			\label{fig:antilambda0_massdiffcuts}
		\end{figure}
		
		The reconstructed mass can be determined by performing a double Gaussian fit on the mass distribution after all cuts.
		The mass distribution and the double Gaussian fit are exemplarily shown for \lam in figure \ref{fig:lambda0_massfit}
		
		\begin{figure}
			\centering
				\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./plots/lambda0/lambda0_m_masscut2.pdf}
			\caption{\propose Mass distribution -- blue line -- for \lam fitted with a double Gaussian fit shown as red dashed line.}
			\label{fig:lambda0_massfit}
		\end{figure}
		
		The mean value of the inner Gaussian fit is the reconstructed mass.
		The result for \lam is $\mt{m}_{\Lambda^0} = \left(1.1158 \pm 0.0022\right)$\massunit and for \alam: $\mt{m}_{\bar{\Lambda}^0} = \left(1.1159 \pm 0.0022\right)$\massunit. 
		Figure \ref{fig:lambda0_pt_vs_pz} shows the transverse momentum versus the longitudinal momentum.
				
		\begin{figure}
			
			\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{./plots/lambda0/lambda0_pt_vs_pz_cut.pdf}}

			\caption{\propose Figure a) shows the transverse against the longitudinal momentum for \lam. Figure b) shows the same distribution for \alam.}
			\label{fig:lambda0_pt_vs_pz}
		
		\end{figure}
		After all cuts the reconstruction efficiency for \lam is $50.33\%$ and for \alam $41.46\%$.
		The difference of the reconstruction efficiency of \lam and \alam is caused by the difference between the decay length of their mother particles.
		\lam is emitted by the \excitedcascade which has a very short decay length while the decay length of \cascade and \anticascade is 
		c$\tau = 4.91 \unit{cm}$ \cite{PDG}.
		The decay length of \lam and \alam is $\textnormal{c}\tau = 7.98 \unit{cm}$, so that the final state particles of \alam are produced more downstream 
		than the final state particles of \lam.
		This can be also seen in figure \ref{fig:lambda0_antilambda0_decay_vtx}.
		The finale state particles coming from \alam are produced at the edge of the MVD detector so that the reconstruction efficiency for this particles get worse.

\section{Reconstruction of \cascade and \anticascade}
	\subsection*{Selection}
		The reconstruction of \cascade and \anticascade follows a similar scheme like the reconstruction of \lam and \alam.
		For \anticascade are \alam and \piplusone recombined and for \cascade in the c.c. channel \lam and \piminusone.
		Now it is distinguished between the to \piplus (\piminus) particle and use only those particles which have not already been combined.
		After combining the daughter particles a mass window cut is performed with a width of $0.3$\massunit around 
		the \cascade mass $m_{\Xi} = 1.32171$ \massunit \cite{PDG}.
		 
		The fitting scheme is the same as for \lam and \alam and is shown in figure \ref{fig:anticascade_scheme} 
		After the mass window cut the daughter particles are fitted to a common vertex with the PndKinVtxFitter.
		And again these information is used to perform the mass constraint fit. 
		
		\begin{figure}
			\centering
				\includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth]{./plots/combineAntiCascade.pdf}
			\caption{\propose Scheme for \anticascade reconstruction}
			\label{fig:anticascade_scheme}
		\end{figure}
		
		Only those particles are selected which have a \chisq probability of more than $1\,\%$ in both fitter. 
		Figure \ref{fig:XiPlus_prob} shows exemplarily the cut on the vertex fit probability.
		
		\begin{figure}
			\centering
				\includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth]{./plots/Xi/XiPlus_prob.pdf}
			\caption{\propose \chisq probability for \anticascade reconstruction}
			\label{fig:XiPlus_prob}
		\end{figure}
			
		If there is more than one candidate left after all cuts, the best candidate is chosen.
		
		
	\subsection*{Results}
		The vertex resolution after all cuts is shown in table \ref{tab:XiPlus_vtxres}. 
		
		\begin{table}
			\centering
			\caption{\propose Vertex resolution for \anticascade and \cascade (c.c. channel)}
			\label{tab:XiPlus_vtxres}
			\begin{tabular}{ccc}
				\hline
				position & \anticascade & \cascade(from c.c.) \\\hline
				\hline
				x/cm & $0.052$ & $0.056$\\
				y/cm & $0.052$ & $0.052$\\
				z/cm & $0.192$ & $0.2$\\
				\hline
				    
			\end{tabular}
		\end{table}
		
		It is determined by calculating the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the distribution.
		The advantage of using this method for calculating the vertex resolution is that the FWHM is independent of distribution shape.
		Figure \ref{fig:xi_vtxres_x} and Figure \ref{fig:xi_vtxres_yz} show the vertex resolution.

		\end{figure}
	
		The mass distribution for the different cuts is shown in figure \ref{fig:XiPlus_massdiffcuts} and figure \ref{fig:XiMinus_massdiffcuts}.
		The number of events is strongly reduced by the cut on the vertex fit probability. 
		The width of the mass distribution gets smaller.

		\end{figure}
		
		After using all cuts on the mass distribution the reconstructed mass of \cascade and \anticascade can be determined by a double Gaussian fit.
		This is exemplarily shown for the \cascade in figure \ref{fig:XiPlus_massfit}.

		\end{figure}
		The result of the mass fit is for \anticascade ${\mt{m} = \left( 1.32172 \pm 0.00396\right)}$ \massunit 
		and for \cascade \\ ${\mt{m} = \left( 1.3216 \pm 0.004\right)}$\massunit.

		\end{figure}
		
		The reconstruction efficiency for \anticascade is $18.39\%$ and for \cascade $18.64\%$.
		
	
	
	

\section{Reconstruction of \excitedcascade and \excitedanticascade}
		\subsection*{Selection}

		For the reconstruction of \excitedcascade one combines \lam with the \kminus meson and for \excitedanticascade \alam and \kplus using the
		best candidate from \lam and \alam.
		After the combination of the particles a mass window cut with width of $0.3$\massunit is performed. 
		The daughter particles are fitted then to a common vertex point with the PndKinVtxFitter.
		Only those candidates for \excitedcascade (\excitedanticascade) are selected which have a fit probability of more then $1\%$.
		The selection scheme is shown in figure \ref{fig:excitedcascade_scheme}.

		The \chisq probability distribution for the vertex fit is shown in figure \ref{fig:xi1820_prob}.
		The distribution is again not flat but increases for values up to one.

		\end{figure}
		
		If there is more than one particle the best candidate is chosen.
		
	\subsection*{Results}
	The vertex resolution for \excitedcascade and \excitedanticascade is summarized in table \ref{tab:Xi1820_vtxres}.
	
	\begin{table}
		\centering
		\caption{\propose Vertex resolution for \excitedcascade and \excitedanticascade.}

	Here again the vertex resolution is calculated with the FWHM.

	After performing both fits and cut on the probability values, the mass for \excitedcascade and \excitedanticascade
	can be determined by fitting with a double Gaussian function. 
	Figure \ref{fig:xi1820_mass_diffcuts} shows the mass distribution for both particles after each cut.

		\label{fig:xi1820_massfit}
	\end{figure}
	The mass value for the \excitedcascade is fitted to $m_{\Xi^{*}} = 1.8229 \pm 3.81 \cdot 10^{-5}$ \massunit
	 and for \excitedanticascade to $m_{\bar{\Xi}^{*}} = 1.823 \pm 3.73\cdot 10^{-5}$ \massunit.
	These values are close to the input value.
	Figure \ref{fig:xi1820_pt_vs_pz} shows the two dimensional momentum distribution. For both subplots the x axis shows the longitudinal momentum
	and on the y axis there is shown the transverse momentum.

	The reconstructed distributions are in good agreement with the distribution coming from the simulated events which are 
	shown in figure \ref{fig:MC_xi_pt_vs_pz} (b).
	
\section{Reconstruction of the whole reaction chain}

	\subsection*{Selection}
	
	To reconstruct the whole reaction chain \excitedcascade and \anticascade are combined.
	This is also done with \excitedanticascade and \cascade for the charge conjugated channel.
	For this reconstruction the event selection is done with an exclusive method.
	The resulting four-momentum vector of both daughter particles --  here \excitedcascade 
	and \anticascade and there c.c. particles -- is fitted with the constraint to match to the initial for momentum vector  

	\begin{center}
		\begin{equation}\nonumber
			\left(\mt{p}_x,\, \mt{p}_y,\, \mt{p}_z,\, \mt{E} \right) = \left(0,\, 0,\, 4.6,\, 5.63 \right)
		\end{equation}
	\end{center}
	of the \pbarpSystem.	
	This fit is performed with the PndKinFitter.
	After the four-momentum fit only those candidates are selected which have a \chisq probability of more than $1\%$.
	The \chisq probability is shown in figure \ref{fig:xisys_prob}. 
	The red line denotes the cut value.
