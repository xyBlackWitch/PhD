The reconstruction of signal events is very well.
Final states partciles have a reconstruction efficiency of nearly $80\%$.
The reconstruction of \lam and \alam shows a difference in the efficiencies.
This is caused by the different mother particles of the \lam and \alam. 
The reconstruction efficiency for \lam and \alam could be improved by using lambda discs.
But this has to be check and is one of the next steps in this analysis.


The reconstructed mass for \excitedcascade and \excitedanticascade is in a good agreement with the literature value comming from \cite{PDG}.

The comparison between the number of signal and background events shows how good background events could be suppressed by the selection. 
For the full reaction chain there are 1234 signal events and 1234 background events left.
