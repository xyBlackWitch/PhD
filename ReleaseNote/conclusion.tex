The reconstruction of signal events is very well.
The hole reaction chain can be reconstructed with an efficiency of nearly $5\%$ for both channels.\\
Final states particles have a reconstruction efficiency of nearly $80\%$.
The reconstruction of \lam and \alam shows a difference in the efficiencies.
This is caused by the different mother particles of the \lam and \alam. 
The reconstruction efficiency for \lam and \alam could be improved by using lambda discs.
But this has to be check and is one of the next steps in this analysis.\\
The reconstructed mass for \excitedcascade and \excitedanticascade is in a good agreement with the literature value coming from \cite{PDG}.

The topology of the decay chain suppresses the background efficiently without optimizing any cut.
The comparison between the number of signal and background events shows how good background events could be suppressed by the selection.
To be able to make a useful comparison between these numbers, more background events have to be simulated.
