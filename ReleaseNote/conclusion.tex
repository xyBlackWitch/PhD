The complete reaction chain can be reconstructed with an efficiency of about $5\%$ for \pbarp $\rightarrow$ \excitedcascade and \anticascade and its
charge conjugate channel.\\
Each final states particle has a reconstruction efficiency of nearly $80\%$.
The reconstruction of \lam and \alam shows a difference in the efficiencies.
This is caused by the different mother particles of the \lam and \alam. 
The reconstruction efficiency for \lam and \alam might be improved by using the so-called lambda discs.
However, this requires further studies which will be a part of future analysis.\\
The reconstructed mass for \excitedcascade and \excitedanticascade is in a good agreement with the literature value \cite{PDG}.

The topology of the decay chain suppresses the background efficiently.
The comparison between the number of signal and background events shows how well background events can be suppressed by the selection criteria.
After the reconstruction of the full reaction chain, the number of simulated signal events is 8614 and the number of background events is zero. 
Assuming one single background event gives a limit for the significance of $S>71.3$.
For a more precise statement a more realistic software together with more background simulations is needed.
