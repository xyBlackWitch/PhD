For background studies 15 million events are simulated with the Dual Parton Model based generator DPM.
To make the events of background and signal comparable after the selection, a scaling factor is needed.
This scaling factor can be calculated with the number of generated events and the cross section of signal and background.
\begin{equation}
		B = \frac{N_\mt{sig}/\sigma_\mt{sig} \cdot \mt{Br}}{N_\mt{bg}/\sigma_\mt{bg}}
\label{eq:bg_scaling}
\end{equation}
Here is $N_\mt{sig}$ the number of generated signal events, $N_\mt{bg}$ the number of generated background events, Br is the branching ratio, $\sigma_\mt{sig} = 1\,\mu\mt{b}$ and $\sigma_\mt{bg} = 50\unit{mb}$ \cite{PANDAphysics2009}.
