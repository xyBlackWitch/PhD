		- change N_sig in table 4.2
		- N_sig/N_bg = 12.4 : 1 -> 11.73:1
		- N_bg * B for Xi(1820)Xi+ 0 -> <6000

22.02.:
	updated trunk revision on local machine: 28555 -> 28931
	PndTool: dev merged with trunk revision 28931

23.02.:
	covariance matrices variated with +- 10% -> no effect
	change of values in Realease Note

24.02.:
	simulation of 500k events for pbar p -> mu+ mu- with p= 3GeV/c
	
07.03.:
	trunk on prometheus rev28555 -> rev 28931
	PndTools on prometheus from trunk (reason: fitter are now included in trunk)
